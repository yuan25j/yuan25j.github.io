As a motivated and dedicated student, I felt it was necessary to create a portfolio website in order to effectively showcase my skills, experience, and accomplishments. This online platform allows me to present my work in a organized and visually appealing manner, highlighting my unique talents and capabilities. Furthermore, having a portfolio website serves as a valuable asset in my career development, providing me with an online presence and making it easier for potential employers and clients to discover and contact me. Overall, creating a portfolio website was a crucial step in my professional growth and I am eager to share my work with the wider community.

What you are viewing this on is the result of this work. The process of creating this website involved several steps, including choosing a domain name, setting up a GitHub repository, and utilizing a Jekyll framework to act as the base for the website. I  took the time to customize the website, adding my own content and design elements to make it truly reflective of my identity.
