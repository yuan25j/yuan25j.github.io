As a person who is always looking to improve and grow, I wanted to spend my summer learning new technologies and creating a small personal project. I wanted to challenge myself and step outside of my comfort zone, and I saw this as an opportunity to do just that. Before attempting this, I had not used CSS, Javascript, or HTML, but I wanted to develop new skills and gain valuable experience. I was also excited about the prospect of completing a project that I could be proud of, and I saw it as a way to explore my interests and hobbies. 

In this project, I used the Live-server extension on vscode to host a webpage, which prompted user input that was used to call the Open Weather API, retrieving detailed meteorological information for an area.
