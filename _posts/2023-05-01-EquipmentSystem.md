Through a special trial seminar offered through my instituion, I was able to participate in a experience that mimicked real word industry work in software engineering. One of topics that this seminar focused on was the full stack development of web applications. Building on an application I worked on earlier, I was able to contribute to system where a user was to sign into a website using university credentials, see equipment offered by clubs(laptops, speakers, etc) and check these items out for use. They were then able to check in the items. There is also a implmented admin mode, where a user can add/edit/delete equipment to the database, view who has equipment checked out, and manually return equipment if a situation arises. This implementation uses a Angular frontend, paired with a fast API python backend. The data is stored locally within a SQL Alchemy database.
