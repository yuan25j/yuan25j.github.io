Through a special trial seminar offered through my instituion, I was able to participate in a experience that mimicked real word industry work in software engineering. One of topics that this seminar focused on was the full stack development of web applications. In one such application, I was able to create a website registration system, where a user could create an account and subsequently check in, saving their check-in time, ID, etc., modeling a process similar to hough it would be to go to a fitness center. This project involved the use of an angular frontend, implementing many rxjs observables, and connecting it to a fast API python backend. All data created during the use of this app is stored in a local database.
