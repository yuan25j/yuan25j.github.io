During my Fall 2022 semester, I was challenged to replicate the Akari game through an individual class project. This project required the implementation of many design patterns, which were some of the primary topics of the class. To those unfamilar with the rules of Akari, please watch this video for a quick introduction: [Video][video-link]

To create this project, I followed the model-view-controller architecture using JavaFx to render the user interface and Java as the backend model and controller. Maven was used to run and organize the project.

Unfortantely, at this time I am unable to upload the code to Github due to academic honesty reasons so please contact me through my email or a message on linked-in if you would like to see my exact code. I have attached below a video demonstration of using the program.


Check out the code on [Youtube][youtube-link] for more info.
