As a programmer, I wanted to challenge myself and test my skills with Advent of Code. I saw it as a great opportunity to improve my problem-solving abilities and learn new techniques through the series of increasingly difficult programming challenges. Additionally, the sense of community and competition that comes with participating in Advent of Code appealed to me, as I enjoy the motivation and satisfaction that comes with tackling tough challenges and competing with others. Overall, I saw Advent of Code as a fun and engaging way to spend the holiday season, and I hoped to come away from it with a stronger foundation in coding and a sense of accomplishment.

I solved questions using the Python language and have uploaded my solutions to github as I progressed.
