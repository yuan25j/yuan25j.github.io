During my summer internship, I had the opportunity to work on a project that involved developing AWS Lambda functions to enhance our account data processing capabilities. My task was to format account data retrieved from internal APIs and use it in conjunction with external vendors to identify recurring subscriptions based on transaction data. I deployed and automated the extraction of key details from the external vendor API responses, including recurrence frequency, subscription amounts, company names, and other pertinent information. This project not only improved our ability to monitor and manage recurring subscriptions but also streamlined the process by ensuring that critical data was readily available for internal use to create digital insights such as tracking spending amounts and categorizing it.

This summer was the first time working with cloud resources and I took time and effort to learn as much as I can, becoming confident in the technologies as I developed throughout summer. This was also my first look and working with AI, with the external vendor being AI powered.
