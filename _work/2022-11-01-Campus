When I first started college, I started working for housing as residental computing consultant. IN this role, my responsibilites included managing our social media accounts for public announcements, solving digital tickets relating to technology in dorm and living spaces, and maintaining housing owned technology such as TV's and lounges. After a year of high performance, I was promoted to be a student manager of my previous role

In my new role, I led and mentored a team of 25 employees in maintaining university housing technology, including TVs and laptops, to ensure seamless operational continuity. I was responsible for overseeing various operational aspects, such as scheduling, hiring, equipment maintenance, and developing new policies for the Carolina Gaming Arena. Additionally, I directed and trained my teammates to adhere to the organization's Service Level Agreement, ensuring high-quality service for over 6,000 clients. This role allowed me to hone my leadership and organizational skills while ensuring that our technology infrastructure met the needs of the university community effectively.
