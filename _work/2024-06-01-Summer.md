After recieveing a return offer from the summer going into my Junior year of college I decieded to return to Truist.

This year, one of my key achievements was enhancing the online banking virtual assistant by consolidating common code across various Lambda functions. This optimization not only streamlined our codebase but also significantly boosted efficiency, saving developers over 200 hours of waiting on building of our application through our traditional CI/CD pipeline. Additionally, I automated the deletion of outdated records in DynamoDB through CloudFormation. This change was approved and is pending to be pushed to production, where it will handle over 10,000 entries daily. Futhermore, working in an Agile environment, I helped execute on planned future sprint initiatives, and participated in iteration planning.
